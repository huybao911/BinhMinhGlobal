## Is it dangerous to post my MAC address publically?

[Not really](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/67893/is-it-dangerous-to-post-my-mac-address-publicly). But you can use the `salt` param to make it impossible to guess the MAC from the generated name. The `salt` is appended to the MAC address before generating the result. The salt is blank by default.

```javascript
var salt = "12345";
console.log(require('name-my-computer').getName(salt)); 
//returns "Eula Tucci"

//suppose we want to convert some arbitrary input [rather than the mac address], into a name...
//console.log(require('name-my-computer').getName(salt, input));
```
